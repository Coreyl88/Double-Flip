Memory Matcher - Double Flip

Pics needed - 8
Cards needed - 16

- Game will start with all cards face down.

- User selects a card to reveal an image.

- User once again selects another card to reveal an image

- If both images match they will remain face up untill the game is 
over. (background will turn to a different color proabably green)

- if both images do not match they will flip back face down and the user will have to try again. (wrong matching cards will have some sort of negative behavior.)

- Once all cards have been matched the game will end signaling that the user has won the game. 

- adding a timer to the game may be a possibility, but idk if i want it.
